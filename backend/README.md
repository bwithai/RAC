# RAC - Backend

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package and environment management.

## General Workflow

By default, the dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), go there and install it.

From `./backend/` you can install all the dependencies with:

```console
$ uv sync
```

Then you can activate the virtual environment with:

```console
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Make sure your editor is using the correct Python virtual environment, with the interpreter at `backend/.venv/bin/python`. In windows `backend/.venv/Scripts/python.exe`


There you can use the `fastapi run --reload` command to run the debug live reloading server.

```console
$ fastapi run --reload app/main.py
```

...it will look like:

```console
root@7f2607af31c3:/app# fastapi run --reload app/main.py
```

and then hit enter. That runs the live reloading server that auto reloads when it detects code changes.
